This project report presents the development of a website that provides comprehensive
information about health services, allowing users to easily schedule appointments with
their preferred doctors, view doctors profiles at available hospitals across Far Western
region of Nepal. The proposed system is designed to enhance the accessibility and
convenience of healthcare services for patients. The website is an integrated platform that
allows users to browse through various healthcare-related activities, view available
hospital information, and book their appointments.

Nepal has a population of approximately 30 million people, and the healthcare system is
primarily run by the government. The country has made significant progress in improving
healthcare outcomes, including a decrease in maternal and child mortality rates.
However, there are still many challenges that the healthcare system faces. One of the
significant challenges is a lack of access to healthcare in remote areas. Most healthcare
facilities are located in urban areas, and people living in rural areas have limited access to
medical care. The healthcare system also faces challenges in the area of infrastructure.
Many healthcare facilities lack basic equipment and supplies, making it difficult for
healthcare professionals to provide quality care. The government has made efforts to
improve infrastructure, but progress has been slow.
Another significant challenge is the cost of healthcare. Many people in Nepal cannot
afford to pay for medical care, which limits their access to healthcare. The government
has implemented programs to provide free medical care to the poor, but these programs
have been limited in their reach. There is shortage of medicine in rural and remote areas
of Nepal. Lack of vaccination affects the immunity power of many children. Without
having knowledge of vaccine time of child hampers the proper growth. Overcrowding in
hospitals can have a significant impact on the quality of services provided to patients.
high numbers of crowds in hospitals can have a significant impact on the services
provided. Delays in treatment, limited resources, increased risk of infection, poor patient
experience, and burnout among healthcare professionals are among the effects of
overcrowding. To address these issues, hospitals need to implement measures to manage
patient flow, increase resources, and improve the patient experience. By addressing these
issues, hospitals can provide better quality care to patients and improve healthcare
outcomes. By providing all these services through online, people get benefits. Online
booking for the appointment reduces the crowd in the hospital.

MEROCARE is the healthcare website platform that provides facilities of Patient portal,
Appointment scheduling, Health education resources, News and blog section. The system
streamlines operations, reduces administrative tasks, and improves patient care.
In this project, a patient can register through online booking for appointment of specialist
doctors with proper information. A patient can search a hospital or clinic with location
with available doctors in patientâ€Ÿs dashboard. An admin dashboard has the patients list
with their information. Proper available data of medicines and manpower will be tracked
by this system. The system wills also the broadcast the information that is initiated by the
government.
This project will be built using the general-purpose language Laravel and its open-source
PHP framework, which is robust, easy to understand, and easy to use. It follows a model-
view-controller design pattern. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, and JavaScript is the set of
technologies considered in developing the user interface of our web application.
